## üß± Included Services

| Service      | Description                          | Port(s)       |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| moodle       | Moodle PHP+Apache server             | 8080:80        |
| db           | MariaDB 11.3 database                | internal only  |

## üïí Cron Job Support

Moodle requires a background task runner (cron) to function correctly.

This setup includes a separate container that automatically runs `cron.php` every 60 seconds.

No further configuration is needed ‚Äì just make sure the service is running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see a container called moodle-cron.

Logs can be viewed with:

```bash
docker compose logs moodle-cron
```

or

```bash
docker logs -f moodle-cron
```

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Volumes

- `moodledata`: Stores Moodle files outside the container (e.g., plugin data, cache)
- `dbdata`: Persistent database storage

These volumes ensure your data is preserved between container restarts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Environment Variables

See the `docker-compose.yml` for all available environment variables.

Minimum required:

- `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`
- `WWWROOT` (URL of the Moodle site)

---

## üîê HTTPS Support with Traefik

You can use a reverse proxy such as [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/), to enable HTTPS via automatic Let's Encrypt certificates.

To use Traefik with this image:

- expose the Moodle container on a Docker network Traefik can access
- use appropriate labels in `docker-compose.yml`
- make sure your domain points to your Traefik instance

You can find Traefik configuration examples in the official documentation.

---

## üõ† Notes

- The Moodle image is built and maintained by [Evomation](https://www.evomation.de)
- The MariaDB version used is `11.3`, the latest LTS release as recommended by Moodle
- You can customize ports, credentials, and volumes as needed
